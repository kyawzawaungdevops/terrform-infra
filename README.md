# Terraform Infrastructure

This repository contains the Terraform configuration files for our infrastructure.

## Overview

Our infrastructure is built using Terraform, a popular infrastructure as code tool. This allows us to version and manage our infrastructure configuration in a consistent and reproducible way.

## Infrastructure Components

Our infrastructure consists of the following components:

* **EC2 Instances**: We use EC2 instances to run our applications. These instances are provisioned using Terraform and are managed using AWS CloudFormation.
* **RDS Databases**: We use RDS databases to store our application data. These databases are provisioned using Terraform and are managed using AWS CloudFormation.
* **S3 Buckets**: We use S3 buckets to store our application files. These buckets are provisioned using Terraform and are managed using AWS CloudFormation.
* **Route 53**: We use Route 53 to manage our DNS records. This allows us to route traffic to our applications.

## Terraform Configuration

Our Terraform configuration files are located in the `terraform` directory. These files define the infrastructure components listed above and are used to provision and manage our infrastructure.

### Variables

We use variables to define the values for our infrastructure components. These variables are defined in the `variables.tf` file and are used throughout our Terraform configuration.

### Modules

We use modules to organize our Terraform configuration into reusable components. These modules are defined in the `modules` directory and are used to provision and manage our infrastructure.

### Outputs

We use outputs to define the values that are returned by our Terraform configuration. These outputs are defined in the `outputs.tf` file and are used to display the values of our infrastructure components.
